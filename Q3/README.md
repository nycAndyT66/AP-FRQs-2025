# Question 3 Analysis
## Matches
This section contains my analysis of Question 2 (Class Design):

### My initial approach during the exam:
- Same idea with question 1, code while reading the instructions after finish analyzing what they wanted you to code.
### My revised solution after review:
- Could've used enhanced for loop to go through the String array.
- Using the enhanced for loop requires me to keep count with an extra variable.
### Key concepts tested in this question:
- ArrayList Concepts(.add(), .get(), .size())
- Making new array list
### What I learned from revisiting this problem:
- One of the more straight forward prompt with it asking you to make an array list of object from other classes.
