## Signature
This section contains my analysis of Question 2 (Class Design):

### My initial approach during the exam:
- Same idea with question 1, code while reading the instructions after finish analyzing what they wanted you to code.
### My revised solution after review:
- All of the conditions fit, may be revisions for this to be simplified further.
### Key concepts tested in this question:
- IndexOf concept;
- Cutting up section of the string (Substring)
### What I learned from revisiting this problem:
- One of the easier FRQ class creation only thing unsure if using this. as part of the code since it's all within the same class.
