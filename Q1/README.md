# Question 1 Analysis
## Dog Walker
This section contains my analysis of Question 1 (Methods and Control Structures):

### My initial approach during the exam:
- During the Exam since time is tight, My approach of this exam is to code while reading the requirements minimum after analyzing it first.
- For part A, I used the method mentioned being updateDog and numAvaliableDogs for the if statements and return statements. One major flaw is overlooking the numAvaliableDogs because returning it after updating would return the updated version.
- For part B, I used an if and if else statement for the bonuses but could've been combined into a single if statement as both would give a bonus as long as one of the conditions is true.
### My revised solution after review:
- For part A, I added a variable to store the initial avaliable dogs for that certain hour and return that variable.
- For part Bl, there's not much to change but maybe combining the conditions into 1 if statement would be more organized.
### Key concepts tested in this question:
- Calling methods
- Calling loop
- Boolean Statement
### What I learned from revisiting this problem:
- By revisiting this problem, I learned how to condense boolean statements into one single boolean statement but was unable to during the time of the exam.
