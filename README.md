# AP-FRQs-2025
_Solutions by Andy Thoong_
## Introduction
This repository contains my solutions and reflections for the AP Computer Science exam taken on 5/7/25. While reviewing the released questions, I've documented my approach, insights gained, and areas for future growth.

## Exam Experience
- In this section, I reflect on my overall experience taking the AP Computer Science exam:

- My preparation strategy for the exam included writing down notes of what I can remember and going over harder topics with video guides.
- The most challenging aspects of the exam were analysis of long written codes to find a possible return statement of the code or a missing line of the code.
- Time management techniques that worked well for me is skipping over questions that might take too long to fully analyze and outlining the code.
- Mental strategies I used when encountering difficult questions is proccess and elimination with some choices being relatively similar which could be eliminated most of the itme.
## Growth Opportunities
Through this review process, I've identified these areas for continued learning:

- Classes/Inheritence: Understanding on how one class could Inherit the properties of it's parent class, a possibility to organize the code with each class having an - important purpose to run the program. Ex(for a game): Player class, mob class, Role class extends Player, etc.
- Recursions: Could be used for efficiency but will slowly shift from for loops into recursions to perform certain tasks like calculations.
- Programming practice: practice how to outline code efficiently and learn De Morgan's law
## Resources
Resources I found helpful during my exam preparation and review:

- CSAwesome: https://runestone.academy/ns/books/published/csawesome/index.html
- GeeksforGeeks: https://www.geeksforgeeks.org
## Future Goals
Moving forward, I plan to:

- Learn the basics of AI/Learn how to code programs that would help me in life.
- Create a code that would simulate a game like FRQ #4
- Organize notes and practice on Comp Sci questions because you need to read a lot to comprehend what the prompt is requesting from you.
