# Question 4 Analysis
## SumorSameGame
This section contains my analysis of Question 2 (Class Design):

### My initial approach during the exam:
- Same idea with question 1, code while reading the instructions after finish analyzing what they wanted you to code.
### My revised solution after review:
- Revised solution contained an more simplified code than from the exam (boolean conditions into one statement, organize loops)
### Key concepts tested in this question:
- 2d Arrays.
- Nested for loops
- boolean statments
- Math.random()
### What I learned from revisiting this problem:
- Math.random formatting must be (max-min+1)+min
